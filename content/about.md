This is an experiment in assigning two-letter codes to episodes of *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*.

## Alt Codes

"Alt" codes are sometimes assigned based on preliminary or unofficial titles.

## How Codes Are Assigned

Codes are generally taken from the first letters of words in the title, and subsequent letters if needed.

Two-part episodes always have the codes "XA" and "XB", where "X" is a prefix determined similarly to what is described above.

Codes are always assigned in order of airing, even when I sometimes haven't kept up with new episodes.

## Source Code

The source code for this site, including the codes in JSON format, are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/jack126guy).
