This is an experiment in assigning two-letter codes to episodes of *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic* as well as [other media in the franchise]({{< relref "/others/_index.md" >}}).

## Alt Codes

"Alt" codes are sometimes assigned based on preliminary or unofficial titles.

## How Codes Are Assigned

Codes are generally taken from the first letters of words in the title, and subsequent letters if needed.

Two-part episodes always have the codes "XA" and "XB", where "X" is a prefix determined similarly to what is described above.

Codes are assigned in order of airing, meaning that they tend to become more convoluted over time. (Codes for other media were assigned starting at the beginning of season 9, not strictly in order of airing.)
