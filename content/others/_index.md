Codes for other media in the franchise, including *Equestria Girls*. Note that this does not include shorts, only media that are at least the length of an episode.

These codes were assigned at the beginning of season 9 and therefore do not follow the general rule of assigning codes in order of airing. (However, they are assigned in order of airing amongst themselves.)
