# FiM Episode Codes

[FiM Episode Codes (FIMEC)](http://jackgraysonfox.tk/fimec/) is an experiment in assigning two-letter codes to episodes of *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*. I don't know why I decided to do this, exactly.

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using a custom theme.

The main drivers of the site are in the `data` directory, which contains the codes in JSON format and can be used directly for other applications.

The `dedup.py` script is a Python script that checks for any duplicate codes.
